abstract = {For this article, we call scientific software a community code if it is freely available, written by a team of developers who welcome user input, and has attracted users beyond the developers. There are obviously many such materials modeling codes. The authors have been part of such efforts for many years in the field of atomistic simulation, specifically for two community codes, the LAMMPS and GULP packages for molecular dynamics and lattice dynamics respectively. Here we highlight lessons we have learned about how to create such codes and the pros and cons of being part of a community effort. Many of our experiences are similar, but we also have some differences of opinion (like modeling vs modelling). Our hope is that readers will find these lessons useful as they design, implement, and distribute their own materials modelling software for others to use.}

abstract = {Since the classical molecular dynamics simulator LAMMPS was released as an open source code in 2004, it has become a widely-used tool for particle-based modeling of materials at length scales ranging from atomic to mesoscale to continuum. Reasons for its popularity are that it provides a wide variety of particle interaction models for different materials, that it runs on any platform from a single CPU core to the largest supercomputers with accelerators, and that it gives users control over simulation details, either via the input script or by adding code for new interatomic potentials, constraints, diagnostics, or other features needed for their models. As a result, hundreds of people have contributed new capabilities to LAMMPS and it has grown from fifty thousand lines of code in 2004 to a million lines today. In this paper several of the fundamental algorithms used in LAMMPS are described along with the design strategies which have made it flexible for both users and developers. We also highlight some capabilities recently added to the code which were enabled by this flexibility, including dynamic load balancing, on-the-fly visualization, magnetic spin dynamics models, and quantum-accuracy machine learning interatomic potentials.
Program Summary
Program Title: Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS) CPC Library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/cxbxs9btsv.1 Developer's repository link: https://github.com/lammps/lammps Licensing provisions: GPLv2 Programming language: C++, Python, C, Fortran Supplementary material: https://www.lammps.org Nature of problem: Many science applications in physics, chemistry, materials science, and related fields require parallel, scalable, and efficient generation of long, stable classical particle dynamics trajectories. Within this common problem definition, there lies a great diversity of use cases, distinguished by different particle interaction models, external constraints, as well as timescales and lengthscales ranging from atomic to mesoscale to macroscopic. Solution method: The LAMMPS code uses parallel spatial decomposition, distributed neighbor lists, and parallel FFTs for long-range Coulombic interactions [1]. The time integration algorithm is based on the Størmer-Verlet symplectic integrator [2], which provides better stability than higher-order non-symplectic methods. In addition, LAMMPS supports a wide range of interatomic potentials, constraints, diagnostics, software interfaces, and pre- and post-processing features. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: This paper serves as the definitive reference for the LAMMPS code.

About 20 to 40 spikes decorate the surface of virions. Turoňová et al. now show that the spike is flexibly connected to the viral surface by three hinges that are well protected by glycosylation sites. The flexibility imparted by these hinges may explain how multiple spikes act in concert to engage onto the flat surface of a host cell. Science, this issue p. 203 Flexible hinges shielded by glycans in the coronavirus spike protein may allow scanning of the host cell surface. The spike protein (S) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is required for cell entry and is the primary focus for vaccine development. In this study, we combined cryo–electron tomography, subtomogram averaging, and molecular dynamics simulations to structurally analyze S in situ. Compared with the recombinant S, the viral S was more heavily glycosylated and occurred mostly in the closed prefusion conformation. We show that the stalk domain of S contains three hinges, giving the head unexpected orientational freedom. We propose that the hinges allow S to scan the host cell surface, shielded from antibodies by an extensive glycan coat. The structure of native S contributes to our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection and potentially to the development of safe vaccines.}

    abstract = { This study develops a modelling framework for simulating the spread of infectious diseases within real cities. Digital copies of Birmingham (UK) and Bogotá (Colombia) are generated, reproducing their urban environment, infrastructure and population. The digital inhabitants have the same statistical features of the real population. Their motion is a combination of predictable trips (commute to work, school, etc.) and random walks (shopping, leisure, etc.). Millions of individuals, their encounters and the spread of the disease are simulated by means of high-performance computing and massively parallel algorithms for several months and a time resolution of 1 minute. Simulations accurately reproduce the COVID-19 data for Birmingham and Bogotá both before and during the lockdown. The model has only one adjustable parameter calculable in the early stages of the pandemic. Policymakers can use our digital cities as virtual laboratories for testing, predicting and comparing the effects of policies aimed at containing epidemics. }

They have been successfully used, for example, to realistically model the behavior of ionic liquids or water-in-salt electrolytes in supercapacitors and batteries. CPMs model conductive electrodes by updating charges of individual electrode atoms according to the applied electric potential and the (time-dependent) local electrolyte structure. Here, we present a feature-rich CPM implementation, called ELECTRODE, for the Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator, which includes a constrained charge method and a thermo-potentiostat. The ELECTRODE package also contains a finite-field approach, multiple corrections for nonperiodic boundary conditions of the particle–particle particle–mesh solver, and a Thomas–Fermi model for using nonideal metals as electrodes. We demonstrate the capabilities of this implementation for a parallel-plate electrical double-layer capacitor, for which we have investigated the charging times with the different implemented methods and found an interesting relationship between water and ionic dipole relaxations. To prove the validity of the one-dimensional correction for the long-range electrostatics, we estimated the vacuum capacitance of two coaxial carbon nanotubes and compared it to structureless cylinders, for which an analytical expression exists. In summary, the ELECTRODE package enables efficient electrochemical simulations using state-of-the-art methods, allowing one to simulate even heterogeneous electrodes. Moreover, it allows unveiling more rigorously how electrode curvature affects the capacitance with the one-dimensional correction.}",

ABSTRACT = {In this work, we investigate the effect of the cation structure on the structure and dynamics of the electrode–electrolyte interface using molecular dynamics simulations. A constant potential method is used to capture the behaviour of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis (trifluoromethane)sulfonimide ([C2mim][NTf2]) and butyltrimethylammonium bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonimide ([N4,1,1,1][NTf2]) ionic liquids at varying potential differences applied across the supercapacitor. We find that the details of the structure in the electric double layer and the dynamics differ significantly, yet the charge profile and capacitance do not vary greatly. For the systems considered, charging results in the rearrangement and reorientation of ions within ∼1 nm of the electrode rather than the diffusion of ions to/from the bulk region. This occurs on timescales of O(10 ns) for the ionic liquids considered, and depends on the viscosity of the fluid.},

We demonstrate the computational savings available in CPM MD simulations of ionic liquid supercapacitors when the usual non-periodic slab geometry is replaced with fully periodic boundary conditions. We show how a doubled cell approach, previously used in non-CPM MD simulations of charged interfaces, can be used to enable fully periodic CPM MD simulations. Using either a doubled cell approach or a finite field approach previously reported by others, fully periodic CPM MD simulations produce comparable results to the traditional slab geometry simulations with a nearly double speedup in computational time. Indeed, these savings can offset the additional cost of the CPM algorithm, resulting in periodic CPM MD simulations that are computationally competitive with the non-periodic, fixed charge equivalent simulations for the ionic liquid supercapacitors studied here.}",

Single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) have become fascinating materials in research and industry for the unique and anomalous properties of their confined water molecules. Here{,} we present a computational molecular dynamics (MD) study to investigate various desalination mechanisms of CDI systems with hydrophilic or hydrophobic armchair SWCNT electrodes with chiral indices of 9{,} 10{,} and 15. The water cluster structure inside the uncharged and charged confinement is shown to be directly influenced by the SWCNT wall wettability and effective pore diameter. The different charge compensation mechanisms of each system are shown to result in significantly different desalination performances. Hydrophilicity increased the ion transport rate{,} while it is shown that this does not necessarily result in better desalination performance at larger pores. We investigate the variation in the solvation structure of ionic species upon confinement. In addition{,} the capacitance of the systems is calculated and no relationship between this metric and desalination capacity is shown to exist. The charge efficiency of the systems as a linking factor between desalination capacity and capacitance is also investigated. The static dielectric constant of confined water molecules and its tensor components are calculated and it is shown that they deviate from the bulk value upon confinement. This study provides clear molecular insights into the relationship between desalination mechanisms and performance and can be useful for CDI electrode design studies."}

abstract={Machine learning potentials have become an important tool for atomistic simulations in many fields, from chemistry via molecular biology to materials science. Most of the established methods, however, rely on local properties and are thus unable to take global changes in the electronic structure into account, which result from long-range charge transfer or different charge states. In this work we overcome this limitation by introducing a fourth-generation high-dimensional neural network potential that combines a charge equilibration scheme employing environment-dependent atomic electronegativities with accurate atomic energies. The method, which is able to correctly describe global charge distributions in arbitrary systems, yields much improved energies and substantially extends the applicability of modern machine learning potentials. This is demonstrated for a series of systems representing typical scenarios in chemistry and materials science that are incorrectly described by current methods, while the fourth-generation neural network potential is in excellent agreement with electronic structure calculations.},
